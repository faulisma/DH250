# Description

You will submit one github page including:
1. One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. Also one paragraph explaining the methodology.
2. The link to your online survey (UT materials), share the survey with the instructor
3. The link to your pilot UT video (e.g., youtube or google drive)* If you have a special concern to share the video, please contact the instructor
4. One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.


# Introduction

CalFresh is the California implementation of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp program, which provides financial assistance for purchasing food to low-income California residents. With about 4.1 million people enrolled in CalFresh, this service reaches many people including single income households, college students, and other low income individuals. The online portal is utilized to check benefits, submit documentation, start new applications, and provide resources to other state run programs, making it a necessity to many people in California. Because it is such an important website, I decided to test the usability of the site to understand what it is doing right and how it can be improved. 

I have pointed out several usability problems based on my heuristic evaluation. 

1) Basic information is not listed on the homepage such as case status (active/inactive), account balance, and the next due date for documentation.
2) The menu section is unclear and has too many options, making it difficult to find important sections such as where you would upload a requested document
3) There are multiple avenues for receiving notices so it is hard to keep track of them all. Notices tell you when new documentation is required from you, changes to your benefit status, and case worker contact information.
4) There is no clear way to contact your case worker.

Conducting a usability test will allow me to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the CalFresh portal. In Task 1, I will ask the user to find their current account balance on their CalFresh account. This task will demonstrate how easy or difficult it is to find the account balance - the #1 reason people use the portal. It will further tell me how well the menu is labeled and how efficient it is to keep the account balance off of the main page. In Task 2, the user will upload a photo of an ID to submit to their case worker. This will assess the efficiency of submitting documentation as this is something that is done frequently. I can observe how the cluttered website affects the time it takes for a user to complete this task. In Task 3, the user is asked to change their preferences to indicate electronic/paperless notices to observe how easy it is to choose a communication method that works for them. In Task 4, I will ask the user to find the message board. This is also allow me to assess the efficacy of the menu and navigation of the site as a whole. I have created a detailed Google form outlining the usability test to use in conjunction with Zoom which will allow me to record the screen, the voices of myself and the participant, and our videos*. Through the survey, I will be able to determine the degree to which the user is satisfied with the website and how comfortable the user is with performing the tasks given to them. This will allow me to assess the usability of the webiste and give me a better idea of where the pain points are on the website.  

* The user has asked that only their voice and screen be shown in the video, not their face. This was asked of me after the completion of the usability test due to some sensitive information being shown in the background of their video (address).  

# Methodology

I will conduct a pilot usability test over Zoom due to the coronavirus pandemic. I will be in a quiet room while my participant will be outside on their patio. I will be using my own Macbook Pro laptop as the recording device while the participant uses their Macbook Pro to explore the webiste. They will use their phone to fill out the survey simultaneously.

I will be sure to get the user's informed consent before proceeding with the usability test through the Google form. I will ask the user to provide detailed commentary about their thought process throughout the usability test. They will indicate the success or lack thereof of the task verbally and through the Google form. The form will also have sections where the user will fill out how comfortable they are with the site, how quickly they were able to complete the tasks, and  lastly, their demographic data which will be kept confidential.
