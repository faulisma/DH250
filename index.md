# Assessing the Usability of the CalFresh Benefits Website

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluating heuristics is a great way to start assessing the user experience of a website. Using [Nielsen's 10 heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), I will evaluate the [CalFresh Benefits](yourbenefits.laclrs.org) site. 

# ADD DESCRIPTION OF SITE AND OVERALL OPINION

### #1: Visibility of system status

Visibility of system status refers to making sure users know what is happening by providing feedback as they use a site. The site itself does a poor job informing users of necessary information. As you can see on the home page above, there is no indication of whether your case is active or inactive, one of the key elements users would need to know during this process. It also does not have a feature to inform you when your next income report/review is due, so the user must calculate their standing themselves. This is more visibility of the CalFresh program status as opposed to the actual website/system, however this can still be addressed in this section. 

Severity rating: 2/3

### #2: Match between system and real world

The site should use terms, references, etc that the user is familiar with. For the most part, this site does a good job with this. 

### #3: User control and freedom

Users should be able to easily control the navigation of the site and how they use it. This site has no explicit back or home button (only the back button from the browser) and when clickinhg the site logo, it logs you out. If users do not know exactly where something is, then most of the time they have to start back at the beginning and try again because of this issue. 

Severity rating: 3/3

### #4: Consistency and standards

Consistent design and functions make for a user friendly site. The CalFresh website does not do this well. The links under different sections are either blue or black with no clear reason why. This is confusing becuase it indicates that the blue links are somehow different than the black links. However, the site does have easily accessible options for changing language, size of font, coloring, etc for the general accessibility standards put in place. 

Severity rating: 1/3

### #5: Error prevention

The site should eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. 

### #6: Recognition rather than recall

As stated in Nielsen's heuristics, the user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. The site does a poor job instructing users on how to use their site, and the main navigation menu disappears once you click on an item.

Severity rating: 3/3

### #7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

The site should allow for a variety of levels of users, allowing for both new users and returning users to use the site efficiently. There is little to no personalization allowed on this website where a user could favorite certain pages/links or change teh settings of the site in general. However, the site does have   options for changing language, size of font, coloring, etc for improved accessibility for a wide range of users. Additionally the navigation can be confusing. When trying to perform certain tasks or find information, there would be multiple menu categories that might possibly relate to what the user wanted to find. A clear, more concise menu bar would greatly benefit the site. 

Severity rating: 2/3

### #8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

The site should be pleasing to the eye. This site is clearly older and has not been updated in quite some time. The header is full of different logos and a lot of links, while the main navigation section contains an overwhelming amount of links and options. 

Severity rating: 1/3

### #9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

The site should utilize error messages that clearly indicate the problem and how to fix it. The site does not do this. It will indicate an error by showing no information in a section or it will give a small message at the bottom saying "unknown error occurred". 

Severity rating: 2/3

### #10: Help and documentation

The site should provide an easy way to ask for help or reference documentation on how to use the site properly. The CalFresh site does not do this well. There is no introduction or welcome section that helps situate users when they first enter the site. There is a resources column with too many links, and there is a YBN Tutorial section that only covers a handful of tasks. This section links to How-To Youtube videos, but otherwise does not allow for searching certaqin questions or errors.

Severity rating: 1/3
